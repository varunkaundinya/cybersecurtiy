## 1. Essential Security Principles

- **Confidentiality** – Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users.  
  *Example:* Encryption of sensitive files.
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered.  
  *Example:* Digital signatures, hashing.
- **Availability** – Ensuring data and systems are accessible when needed.  
  *Example:* Backup systems, redundancy.
- **Authentication** – Verifying user identity.  
  *Example:* Username & password, biometrics, MFA.
- **Authorization** – Determining access levels for authenticated users.
- **Non-repudiation** – Preventing denial of actions.  
  *Example:* Audit logs, signed transactions.
- **Least Privilege Principle (PoLP)** – Giving minimum necessary access to users.
- **Defense in Depth** – Multiple layers of security controls to protect assets.

## 2. Basic Network Security Concepts

- **Firewall** – Filters traffic between trusted and untrusted networks.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** – Monitors for malicious activity.
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** – Blocks malicious traffic in real-time.
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** – Encrypts communication over public networks.
- **Secure Network Design**  
  - Segmentation (VLANs)
  - DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
  - Zero Trust Architecture
- **IPSec & SSL/TLS** – Protocols for securing data transmission.
- **Network Access Control (NAC)** – Restricts unauthorized devices.
- **Port Security** – Prevents unauthorized devices from connecting.

## 3. Endpoint Security Concepts

- **Antivirus & Anti-malware** – Protects endpoints from threats.
- **Host-based Firewall** – Filters traffic on a specific device.
- **Patch Management** – Keeping systems updated with security fixes.
- **Disk Encryption** – Protects data at rest.
- **Application Whitelisting** – Only approved applications can run.
- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** – Monitors and mitigates endpoint threats.
- **USB/Peripheral Control** – Restricts removable device usage.
- **Secure Configuration** – Disabling unused services and ports.

## 4. Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Management

- **Vulnerability Assessment** – Identifying weaknesses in systems.  
  *Example tools:* Nessus, OpenVAS.
- **Penetration Testing** – Simulating attacks to test defenses.
- **Risk Management Steps**  
  1. Identify assets.
  2. Identify threats.
  3. Assess vulnerabilities.
  4. Analyze risk impact & likelihood.
  5. Apply controls.
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies**  
  - Avoidance (Stop risky activity)
  - Mitigation (Apply controls)
  - Transfer (Insurance)
  - Acceptance (Live with risk)
- **Common Vulnerabilities** – Misconfigurations, outdated software, weak passwords.

## 5. Incident Handling

- **Incident Response Steps (NIST Framework)**  
  1. **Preparation** – Policies, training, tools ready.
  2. **Identification** – Detecting incidents.
  3. **Containment** – Limit the spread.
  4. **Eradication** – Remove the threat.
  5. **Recovery** – Restore normal operations.
  6. **Lessons Learned** – Improve for future.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)** – Roles and responsibilities.
- **Chain of Custody** – Maintaining evidence integrity for investigations.
- **Communication Plan** – Reporting incidents to stakeholders.
- **Post-Incident Review** – Root cause analysis.
