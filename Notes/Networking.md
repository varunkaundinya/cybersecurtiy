 Networking Notes

## 1. Networking Fundamentals
- **Definition of Networking** – Connecting devices to share resources and data.
- **Types of Networks**:
  - **LAN** (Local Area Network) – Small geographic area, high speed.
  - **WAN** (Wide Area Network) – Covers large geographic areas.
  - **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network) – City-wide coverage.
  - **PAN** (Personal Area Network) – Very short range, e.g., Bluetooth.
- **Network Topologies**:
  - **Bus** – All devices share a single communication line.
  - **Star** – All devices connect to a central hub/switch.
  - **Ring** – Devices connected in a closed loop.
  - **Mesh** – Every device connects to every other device.
- **IP Addressing**:
  - **IPv4** – 32-bit address, e.g., `192.168.1.1`
  - **IPv6** – 128-bit address, e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`
  - **Private vs Public IPs**
  - **Subnetting** – Dividing a network into smaller segments.
- **OSI Model** – 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.
- **TCP/IP Model** – 4 layers: Network Access, Internet, Transport, Application.

## 2. Network Devices
- **Router** – Connects different networks and forwards data packets.
- **Switch** – Connects devices in a LAN and forwards based on MAC addresses.
- **Hub** – Broadcasts data to all connected devices (less secure).
- **Access Point (AP)** – Provides wireless connectivity.
- **Modem** – Converts digital data to analog for internet transmission.
- **Firewall** – Filters and monitors traffic based on rules.
- **Gateway** – Acts as an entry/exit point for network communication.

## 3. Network Services & Protocols
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** – Automatically assigns IP addresses.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** – Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – Web communication protocols (secure and insecure).
- **FTP/SFTP** – File transfer protocols.
- **SMTP/IMAP/POP3** – Email sending and receiving protocols.
- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** – Manages network devices.
- **NTP (Network Time Protocol)** – Synchronizes system clocks.

## 4. Cabling & Wireless Standards
- **Ethernet Cables**:
  - **Cat5e** – Supports up to 1 Gbps.
  - **Cat6/Cat6a** – Supports 10 Gbps.
  - **Fiber Optics** – High-speed, long-distance communication.
- **Wireless Standards (IEEE 802.11)**:
  - **802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax** – Different speeds and frequencies.
  - **2.4 GHz** – Wider range, slower speed.
  - **5 GHz** – Faster speed, shorter range.

## 5. Network Security Basics
- **Firewalls** – Control incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **VPN** – Secure encrypted connections over the internet.
- **MAC Filtering** – Allowing only approved devices.
- **WPA3 Encryption** – Latest Wi-Fi security standard.
- **IDS/IPS** – Intrusion detection and prevention systems.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** – Define allowed/denied traffic.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting & Tools
- **Ping** – Test network connectivity.
- **Traceroute** – Show path packets take to a destination.
- **IPConfig / IFConfig** – View and configure network settings.
- **NSLookup** – Check DNS records.
- **Netstat** – View active connections.
- **Packet Sniffers** – Monitor and analyze network traffic (e.g., Wireshark).
