# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Basics

## 1. What is Cybersecurity?
- The practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.
- Aims to ensure **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)**.

---

## 2. CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – Only authorized users can access the data.
- **Integrity** – Data remains accurate and unaltered.
- **Availability** – Systems and data are available when needed.

---

## 3. Types of Cybersecurity
- **Network Security** – Protecting network infrastructure from threats.
- **Application Security** – Securing software and apps against vulnerabilities.
- **Information Security** – Protecting data at rest and in transit.
- **Cloud Security** – Safeguarding data and apps in cloud environments.
- **Endpoint Security** – Securing devices like laptops, mobiles, and IoT.
- **Operational Security** – Protecting processes and procedures in an organization.

---

## 4. Common Cyber Threats
- **Malware** – Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware.
- **Phishing** – Deceptive attempts to steal sensitive information.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** – Intercepting communication between two parties.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS)** – Overloading a system to make it unavailable.
- **SQL Injection** – Injecting malicious queries into a database.
- **Zero-Day Exploit** – Attacks that occur before a patch is available.

---

## 5. Cybersecurity Best Practices
- Use strong and unique passwords.
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
- Keep systems and software updated.
- Backup data regularly.
- Limit user access based on need.
- Use firewalls and antivirus software.
- Educate users about social engineering.

---

## 7. Cybersecurity Frameworks & Standards
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **ISO/IEC 27001**
- **CIS Controls**
- **OWASP Top 10** (Web application security risks)

---

## 8. Cybersecurity Tools (Examples)
- **Wireshark** – Network analysis.
- **Nmap** – Network scanning.
- **Metasploit** – Penetration testing.
- **Burp Suite** – Web vulnerability scanning.
- **Snort** – Intrusion detection.
